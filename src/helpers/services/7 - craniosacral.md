Craniosacral therapy is a gentle and non-invasive form of bodywork that is designed to promote deep relaxation and release tension and pain throughout the body. This technique focuses on the craniosacral system, which includes the bones, tissues, and fluids that surround and protect the brain and spinal cord. By using a light touch, craniosacral therapy can help to release restrictions and imbalances in this system, allowing for improved circulation, reduced pain and tension, and increased relaxation and overall wellbeing. Whether you are dealing with chronic pain, stress, or other health issues, craniosacral therapy may be a powerful tool to help you find relief and restore balance to your body and mind.
