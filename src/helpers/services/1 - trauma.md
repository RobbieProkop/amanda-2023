At the heart of my massage therapy practice is a deep commitment to providing trauma-informed care to all of my clients. With specialized training and experience, I have developed a unique approach to bodywork that is specifically tailored to meet the needs of individuals who have experienced trauma.

Booking a trauma-informed massage therapy session with me means that you can rest assured that your safety, comfort, and wellbeing are my top priorities. Before each session, I take the time to ask certain questions and pay special attention to your individual needs and concerns.

During the initial session, I may conduct a longer intake portion to ensure that we are both on the same page and that I have a clear understanding of your specific needs and goals for the session. From there, I will work with you to create a customized treatment plan that is designed to help support your journey towards improved health, greater resilience, and a deeper sense of inner peace.
