    'Therapeutic massage is not a "no pain no gain" treatment. Instead, I focus on slowly working through the layers of tissue, paying close attention to any resistance or tension that may arise. I am patient and allow the tissue to release before going deeper, ensuring that my clients are comfortable and that any discomfort they may feel is the "good" type of pain.',
    "Throughout the massage, there is active communication between the client and myself to ensure that the pressure is appropriate and that they are experiencing optimal benefits. In addition to using pressure, I also receive signals from the body I am touching, which helps me to intuitively determine where to focus my attention next.",
    "Therapeutic massage may include a variety of techniques, such as passive stretching, trigger point release, range of motion movement, and fascial work. These techniques are tailored to meet the unique needs of each client and can be highly effective for reducing pain, improving mobility, and promoting overall healing.",
